# singlePY-connet-to-Helldivers2CallForStratagemsOnPhone
just use a single py program to connet and send to WisteFinch's Helldivers2CallForStratagemsOnPhone's server.
I write it because i want to use my ajazz stream deck to control it.
please use it with 
https://github.com/WisteFinch/Helldivers2CallForStratagemsOnPhone

usage:
First, use the mobile client within to connect to the server once. Extract the sid from auth.json in the server folder and write it into config.json in the command folder. Also, remember to change the IP. Then you can start using it.
